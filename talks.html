                it. Really! Then, with the easy stuff out of the way, we’ll dive
                into the math behind the solution, teach it to a computer, and
                demonstrate the result with a live solve on a Bluetooth Rubik’s

                The Rubik’s Cube is a famous puzzle that’s notorious for being
                difficult to solve. In this talk, we’ll show how math can be used
                to simplify the problem to the point that a human can solve it
                intuitively or write a clear and concise program do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ll begin by covering some basic Group Theory concepts, and
                demonstrate how these can be used to model a Rubik’s Cube in a
                simple way that lends itself well to analysis. Examples will be
                demonstrated using a Bluetooth enabled Rubik’s Cube that allows for
                automatic analysis on the big screen while preserving speed and
                flexibility. Next, we’ll code up a solution that directly takes
                advantage of this mathematical structure. For this we’ll leverage
                an existing scala library for computational group theory. Finally,
                we’ll test this program with a live solve on our Bluetooth Rubik’s
                Cube, so we can analyze the produced solution in a step-by-step
                fashion.

                I started work on Fury on my flight home from NE Scala 2018, so
                this year’s symposium marks an important anniversary for Fury, as

                Fury is a radical new build tool for developing software written
                in Scala and other JVM languages. It starts with a completely blank
                canvas and not only takes on the challenges of developing maintainable
                and composable build definitions, but has bold aspirations to shake
                up the way we publish and distribute software, too: Fury aims to
                make binary compatibility issues a thing of the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                This talk will be a rapid, but practical demonstration of using
                Fury. You will learn how easy it is to create builds for existing
                Scala projects and for new ones. You will discover how fast, intuitive
                and responsive Fury’s user interface is, and will get to see Fury’s
                out-of-the-box support for common (but traditionally difficult)
                build tasks like code generation, benchmarking and publishing.

              Come see how we’ve made use of Scala to build an ETL framework that
              preserves many of the benefits of off-the-shelf platforms while
              solving many of the problems - it is resilient, typesafe, testable,

              ETL has a reputation of being untestable, disconnected
              from the systems that produce and use the data, and
              generally annoying and not fun to work on. Yet it is a
              critical part of most companies’ infrastructure. If you
              ask around for technologies to use for ETL, it is
              unlikely someone will recommend Scala. But over the
              last year, we’ve used some of Scala’s unique features
              to build out an ETL framework that is resilient, testable,
              type safe, and in the same domain model as the surrounding
              applications, while also having many of the same features
              as tools specialized for ETL such as abstracting over
              source and destination and making it easy to add new
              jobs. In this talk, I will present the overall framework
              architecture and some example jobs while also highlighting
              the key Scala features that made this possible (generics,
              type classes, traits, futures, and of course extensive
              use of flatMap).

              Mu offers code annotations for defining RPC or REST APIs, message
              types, and serialization formats, thus removing the dependency on
              protocol-specific declarations and enabling seamless changes between
              different implementations.

              In just 15 minutes, you’ll learn how to use Mu, a new FP library
              for building microservices, to help reduce pain points while
              developing APIs. Learn to model your service APIs using Tagless
              Final algebras without worrying about protocol-specific details or
              serialization formats. Mu will minimize your struggle!

                Learning the type classes from Cats and Scalaz can be difficult without a
                guide. By presenting the most well-known type classes visually, we can more
                easily understand their capabilities and the relationship between them.
