              <p>
                I started work on Fury on my flight home from NE Scala 2018, so
                this year’s symposium marks an important anniversary for Fury, as
                it approaches a first release.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fury is a radical new build tool for developing software written
                in Scala and other JVM languages. It starts with a completely blank
                canvas and not only takes on the challenges of developing maintainable
                and composable build definitions, but has bold aspirations to shake
                up the way we publish and distribute software, too: Fury aims to
                make binary compatibility issues a thing of the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                This talk will be a rapid, but practical demonstration of using
                Fury. You will learn how easy it is to create builds for existing
                Scala projects and for new ones. You will discover how fast, intuitive
                and responsive Fury’s user interface is, and will get to see Fury’s
                out-of-the-box support for common (but traditionally difficult)
                build tasks like code generation, benchmarking and publishing.

                In five minutes, I’ll teach everything you need to know to solve
                it. Really! Then, with the easy stuff out of the way, we’ll dive
                into the math behind the solution, teach it to a computer, and
                demonstrate the result with a live solve on a Bluetooth Rubik’s

                The Rubik’s Cube is a famous puzzle that’s notorious for being
                difficult to solve. In this talk, we’ll show how math can be used
                to simplify the problem to the point that a human can solve it
                intuitively or write a clear and concise program do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ll begin by covering some basic Group Theory concepts, and
                demonstrate how these can be used to model a Rubik’s Cube in a
                simple way that lends itself well to analysis. Examples will be
                demonstrated using a Bluetooth enabled Rubik’s Cube that allows for
                automatic analysis on the big screen while preserving speed and
                flexibility. Next, we’ll code up a solution that directly takes
                advantage of this mathematical structure. For this we’ll leverage
                an existing scala library for computational group theory. Finally,
                we’ll test this program with a live solve on our Bluetooth Rubik’s
                Cube, so we can analyze the produced solution in a step-by-step
                fashion.

              Some new companies and community members who would have initially
              considered Scala are instead looking to Kotlin, while others are
              jumping ship completely for the purer shores of Haskell. From strong
              foundations, I’ll try and make the case that Scala still fulfills
              a viable niche and continues to be a great tool for modeling problems.

                In this talk, we discuss how to use Domain knowledge around your product to
                help improve your Software Quality. We use Domain Driven Testing tools to
                ensure we validate what your customers work with, rather than what you
                think they might use.

                “I tested it how you told me to,” “Requirements say it’s expected,” “I
                assumed it’s fine” – these are the common phrases you hear when customer
                cases come up. Unfortunately, it is nothing unusual in our industry to be
                detached from customers’ actual needs. As a result, teams regularly fail
                when they prioritize requirements over actual behaviour that the customers
                expect.
              </p>
              <p>
                This problem of misaligned teams’ focus is where Domain Driven Testing
                (DDT) comes into play. DDT helps developers to put themselves into the
                customers’ shoes and see the product for what it is. This prioritization of
                the actual behaviour over the mere following of the requirements is what
                defines Domain Driven Testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this talk, we discuss how knowledge of your company’s domain (aka, the
                focus of your business) can improve your testing practices. We talk about
                Domain Driven Design techniques, Exploratory Testing, and other methods
                which emphasize software quality through customers’ success. We touch bases
                on tools you can integrate into your system using Domain Driven Test
                Pyramid, and what common mistakes you should avoid when implementing Domain
                Driven Testing.

                There is general consensus on the fact that code reviews are an important
                step for a successful development workflow. Most organizations undergo code
                reviews of some form.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it’s all too common to see reviewers that barely scratch the
                surface of the work being put forth, or that offer feedback that is unclear
                or hard to act upon. This robs the team from the opportunity to speed up
                learning, share knowledge and context, and from generally raising the
                quality bar on the software being built.

                In this talk, I will share my story of encountering a new code review
                process when joining Shopify, and the surprising learnings I found - even
                as an experienced developer. I will discuss the tremendous gains
                individuals and teams can reap from a thoughtful, well structured review
                process. I will also share some practical techniques we use to help both
                the reviewers and the reviewees do a fantastic job at crafting solid
                deliverables.

                Having worked for various clients as a software consultant, it has always
                been my responsibility to write and make write good software - program that
                is type-driven, purely functional and maintainable. With this talk, we
                intend to prove that, <b>regardless of the complexities and impurities that we
                have to deal when implementing a use-case, the software that we expose to
                clients can still be made reasonable, testable, deterministic and typesafe.
                This is done by taking a Kafka streaming application as the use case.</b>

                As Kafka becomes a powerful stack for various companies to solve their

                Starting from listing down some of the runtime complexities and consequent
                challenges that we faced when playing with Kafka, I will describe a part of
                the use case we implemented for an insurance company, where we wanted to
                abstract out a Kafka streams application that can work for multiple

              <p>
                After listing down the challenges and then describing a streaming use-case,
                we will start with an initial version of the solution written in Scala with
                a few type class constraints. Then, we will list down a bunch of issues
                with the code, motivating us to further improve. Then we go step by step
                towards a final code base listing down the issues motivating us to improve
                the code at every stage to finally reach somewhere we see <code>InvariantFunctors</code>
                and <code>type class</code> constraints playing out nicely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, we will focus on writing test cases for a Kafka application that
                involves playing around with an unsafe data type such as Avro’s
                GenericRecord. This part of the talk intends to prove that, “If bad things
                are done for reasons, make sure we do good things in the test package.” We
                will see some nice examples that gets us away from mutability horribleness
                by making use of any <code>F</code> that can form <code>MonadState</code>,
                reaching out to <code>scalacheck.Gen</code> as an instance.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will also touch base through an upcoming plugin sbt-kafka-compose that
                abstracts out the vagueness and fragility of docker integration tests with
                Kafka. This is also a place where John’s effect rotation code using ZIO
                being applied !
              </p>
              <p>
                And hopefully, I will have more things to show, such as a pure tagless
                final code base streamlining a kafka application. Finally we are here to
                prove, how all these make our code extremely robust and safe!

                Haskell is often brought up when learning functional programming in Scala,

                When was the last time you took a day off? How many times this week have
                you worked overtime? These questions are related to one thing we all
                experience on a daily basis - stress. Employees who are trapped by their
                routine to “deliver business value at all cost”, often forget to take care
                of themselves. Unfortunately, this work-related stress affects our loved
                ones too, because work-life balance that we all hear about, usually means

                When in the course of software development it becomes necessary to dissolve
                the pointless limitations of misguided query generation frameworks, and
                assume the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Mathematics and
                Principles of Good Programming inspire them, a decent respect to the
                notions of sanity require that they should declare the principles that
                impel them to architect Quill.
              </p>
              <p>
                We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all Queries should be
                typesafe and composeable, and that they should be endowed by their
                framework with Functional and Monadic Properties.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  That to allow these capabilities in production environments, requires the
                  consent of Ops and DBAs - who have the unalienable Right, to see the
                  freaking query that will be executed in their environment before getting a
                  2am phone call!
                </li>
                <li>
                  That it is within the power of developers to generate queries during
                  compile-time, such that the requirements of the previous point can easily
                  be accommodated. This is furthermore facilitated by the use of Typeclasses
                  to allow abstractions over query compositions during compile-time.

                <li>
                  Whenever any form of database becomes conducive to these ends, it is within

                Java NIO is a standard way to read and write remote files using familiar local-IO interfaces, but it leaves a lot of type-safety and ergonomics on the table: - various URI schemes are supported via brittle SPI classloader tricks - the API surface is large, and not applicable to many file stores; UnsupportedOperationExceptions ensue - excessive mutability is assumed, e.g. channels typically have both read and write capabilities, but only use one - etc.
              </p>

                After years of frustration, I made an attempt at a pure, portable, Scala NIO replacement. I use it in server- and web-apps, and it lets my portable libraries’ tests assert against “expected” values serialized to local files, removing an awkward asymmetry between JVM- and JS-based tests. It solves many points I had, that also seem close to but not covered by http4s or fs2.

              ETL has a reputation of being untestable, disconnected
              from the systems that produce and use the data, and
              generally annoying and not fun to work on. Yet it is a
              critical part of most companies’ infrastructure. If you
              ask around for technologies to use for ETL, it is
              unlikely someone will recommend Scala. But over the
              last year, we’ve used some of Scala’s unique features
              to build out an ETL framework that is resilient, testable,
              type safe, and in the same domain model as the surrounding
              applications, while also having many of the same features
              as tools specialized for ETL such as abstracting over
              source and destination and making it easy to add new
              jobs. In this talk, I will present the overall framework
              architecture and some example jobs while also highlighting
              the key Scala features that made this possible (generics,
              type classes, traits, futures, and of course extensive
              use of flatMap).

                This talk is focused on what I have found to be most effective for
                teaching Scala. It includes recommendations in three categories. I
                will explore teaching techniques, such as peer learning. I will
                also describe suggestions specific to teaching programming, such
                as the differences between experts and novices, notional machines,
                and more. Finally I will share programming strategies and a suggested
                curriculum specifically targeted to teaching Scala. Improved teaching
                results in a better experience for all parties. That means more

              ORMs are slow and frustrating and SQL queries are giant, type-unsafe
              strings, incapable of modular reuse. Functional programming lets
              you access your database without sacrificing composition (modularity

                Many programmers who need database support either use an Object Relational
                Mapper or give up and use SQL strings and manually parse result sets. Both
                approaches have significant drawbacks for the developer and the business,
                including poor reuse (monolithic, non-reusable query fragments), poor
                composability, poor type safety, and poor testability.

                In this talk, the author will present Slick, a Functional Relation Mapping
                library for Scala. Slick allows you to express queries in an embedded,
                type-checked, collections-like DSL, which is compiled at runtime into SQL
                and executed on the underlying database.

              <p>
                The author will then show you techniques enabling you to implement database
                queries in a generic, reusable, self-contained, modular fashion. This
                enables application-level functionality to be implemented once, efficiently
                and correctly, using functional programming techniques to provide reuse,
                compositionality, type safety, and testability, all without sacrificing
                high performance. Time permitting, we’ll briefly venture into the Category

                  My presentation will illustrate that the above model is acceptable.
                  However, a team will not communicate effectively if a team that has been
                  taken apart and separated due to disconnection and lack of communication.

                  missions, and when united, the team members will form successful
                  finalization of their team-goal. By applying ALS, the team’s entire task

                  As with all teams, each team was placed together because at the initial
                  conception of the group; it was assumed that the team element is within the
                  excellent working order. However, the appreciation of the team model must
                  be well-oiled, and if not, members of the team will individually lack the
                  proper function that is necessitated for TEAMWORK and fail to produce.

                Generic Programming in Scala has always been an interesting topic. Dozens
                of libraries that we use in scala is based on the concepts that we will be
                covering in this talk.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently, we have had a chance to write a web application that tries to
                deploy a multi-tenanted infrastructure in cloud. We will share the success
                story of how quick and easy was it to implement the same with the backing
                of Generic Programming and FP concepts, and thereby produce an application
                that was bang on in the production environment with seriously no bugs. In
                short, we have got a resource differencing algorithm written in scala using
                automatic type class derivation. The application then performs a fast and
                robust refresh of resources in the cloud based on the declarative HOCCON
                based DSL written by the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will cover the concepts in shapeless, share the logic of resource
                differencing algorithm, discuss the must-know concepts of scalaz-deriving
                and in fact discuss about how can we do this with macros in Scala directly.
                I will not forget to mention about Generic Programming coming up in Scala 3
                while discussing about the pros and cons of all these approaches.

                The talk is intended to motivate the FP lovers to look much more deeper
                into the power of Scala, and enable developers to easily uncover the
                possibility of building much more robust libraries for their clients.

              </p>

                This project currently provides:
              </p>
              <p>
                A) a complete, versioned, numerically generic, type-safe / typeful API to
                ONNX(Open Neural Network eXchange, an open format to represent deep
                learning and classical machine learning models), derived from the Protobuf
                definitions and the operator schemas (defined in C++) via the JavaCPP
                Preset for ONNX.
              </p>
              <p>
                This API is expressed via traits, with version-named methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                B) a program generator, capable of translating ONNX model Protobuf (.onnx)
                files into Scala programs written in terms of this API.
              <p>
                ONNX-Scala will also be home to:
              </p>
              <p>
                C) at least one, eventually many backend implementations of ONNX accessible
                from the JVM.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently there is a rough sketch of an
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph">
                  nGraph
                </a>
                backend, which is capable of
                running a single ReLU node network, based on the new nGraph JavaCPP Preset.
              </p>
              <p>
                All together, these should enable model inspection and modification, extra
                compile-time assurances, mixing/matching of backend operator
                implementations and integration into JVM-based production systems, for a
                start.
