            We're looking for many different kinds of talks, at all levels

            community will vote on the talks, but the talks will be anonymized.
            We'll be voting on <i>topics</i>, not speakers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be creative in your talk proposals. Propose a talk on <i>anything</i>
            that might be of interest to the Scala community. Possible topics include,
            but aren't limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the Scala language, ecosystem, or tooling</li>
            <li>
              functional programming—in any language, not just Scala
            </li>
            <li>
              big data and data science (even if you absolutely must use Python)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In short, <i>anything</i> you think might interest Scala programmers
            is fair game.

          Since 2011, the New York, Boston, and Philadelphia Scala meetups have
          hosted this community-driven Scala conference. Because the
          Northeast Scala Symposium (NEScala, to its friends) is
          community-driven, <i>you</i> help create it. The NEScala talks are
          <a target="_blank"href="https://www.papercall.io/ne-scala-2019">
            proposed by the attendees

          interpreting the history of chemistry, chemical engineering, and the
          life sciences. Headquartered in Philadelphia, with offices in
          California and Europe, the Institute houses an archive and a
          library for historians and researchers, a fellowship program for
          visiting scholars from around the globe, a community of researchers
          who examine historical and contemporary issues, an acclaimed museum
          that is free and open to the public, and a state-of-the-art

          is our top sponsor this year. In addition to covering the cost
          of having all three days at the Science History Institute,
          representatives from Bridgewater are on this year's organizing
          committee. Among other things, they have provided valuable guidance
          as we formally initiate our efforts to expand diversity.

        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          <i>This is a draft version of our new code of conduct. The wording
          may change a little between now and the conference. The essential
          message, though, will remain the same.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Northeast Scala Symposium is committed to providing an environment
          that encourages and empowers its members to teach, learn, and
          collaborate.  We welcome every skill level – from beginners to
          experts – to participate and advance the Scala community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Importantly, our members represent multiple dimensions of
          difference – across gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
          orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
          religion, and more – and we want everyone to feel comfortable
          bringing their full selves to the conference.
        </p>

        <p>
          This means all members should apply a high degree of care and
          consideration to how they interact with others. We do not tolerate
          harassment in any form, but also want to go even further in
          actively creating an environment of belonging, inclusion, safety.
          Anyone acting contrary to the spirit of this mission will be asked to
          leave the conference at the discretion of the organizers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The day of the conference, we will have a telephone hotline and
          a Slack channel (or similar mechanism) available for instant and
          anonymous feedback. The details on how to access those resources
          will be posted here. If at any
          point during the conference you experience an issue in this regard,
          we encourage you to use the hotline. If you have less urgent
          feedback, you are welcome to post it (again, anonymously) to the
          Slack channel.
        </p>

        <p>
          The organizers have developed a formal set of procedures for handling
          complaints, including a chain of escalation.
