          Join the NYC, Boston, and Philadelphia Scala meetups in Brooklyn, <b>March 12-14, 2020</b>, to celebrate <b>10 years of NEScala</b>!
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2011, the New York, Boston, and Philadelphia Scala meetups have
          hosted this community-driven Scala conference. Because the
          Northeast Scala Symposium (NEScala, to its friends) is
          community-driven, <i>you</i> help create it. The NEScala talks are
          proposed by the attendees, who then vote to select which will be given.

    <!-- Code of Conduct -->
    <section id="code">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          The Northeast Scala Symposium is committed to providing an environment
          that encourages and empowers its members to teach, learn, and
          collaborate.  We welcome every skill level – from beginners to
          experts – to participate and advance the Scala community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Importantly, our members represent multiple dimensions of
          difference – across gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
          orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
          religion, and more – and we want everyone to feel comfortable
          bringing their full selves to the conference.
        </p>

        <p>
          This means all members should apply a high degree of care and
          consideration to how they interact with others. We do not tolerate
          harassment in any form, but also want to go even further in
          actively creating an environment of belonging, inclusion, safety.
          Anyone acting contrary to the spirit of this mission will be asked to
          leave the conference at the discretion of the organizers.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the conference, we have dedicated incident handlers
          and a Slack channel available for feedback. Please see the
          <a href="#reporting">Reporting and Feedback</a> section for details.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="reporting">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Reporting and Feedback</h2>

        <h3>Reporting an incident</h3>
        <p>
          To report a troubling incident, a violation of the
          <a href="#code">Code of Conduct</a>, or medical issue,
          you can approach any of the conference organizers. But, two
          <a href="organizers.html">organizers</a>, Yifan Xing and Brian Clapper, are designated incident
          handlers who should always be easily be located during
          each day of the conference.
        </p>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="organizers.html">organizers</a> have developed a formal
          set of procedures for handling
          complaints, with a chain of escalation that includes the staff
          and administration at the Science History Institute. Depending
          on the incident, escalation may include emergency services or law
          enforcement. Any reported incident will be documented, and the
          organizers will keep the identities of those who report incidents
          confidential.
        </p>

        <h3 id="feedback">General Feedback &amp; a Slack Team</h3>
        <p>
          The organizers have established a Slack team,
          <a href="https://nescala.slack.com" target="_blank">
            nescala.slack.com
          </a>. Because of the way Slack works, you have to be invited into
          the team, but <i>anyone</i> already on the team can invite anyone
          else. If you bought a ticket, you will receive an invitation to
          join the team. If you did not receive an invitation, just drop an
          email to Brian Clapper (bmc@clapper.org). Or ask a friend who's already on
          the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a special <code>#feedback</code> channel on the team, where
          you can leave general conference feedback. There's also an
          <code>#incidents</code> channel, to allow reporting of incidents
          via Slack. You can use
          <a href="https://www.fifthbot.dev/docs" target="_blank">FifthBot</a>
          to submit anonymous messages, which are moderated. For instance:
        </p>
        <p>
        <code>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;/fifthbot I love the #feedback channel! What an awesome idea!
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also DM the <a href="organizers.html">organizers</a>
          directly, with feedback or concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Please note</b>: It's difficult for us to take action on an
          incident submitted via an anonymous Slack message. It's really best
          if you approach one of the organizers directly (and discreetly).
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, the <a href="#code">Code of Conduct</a> also applies
          to interactions on our Slack team.
