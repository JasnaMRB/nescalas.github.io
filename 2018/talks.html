          </div>
          <div class="abstract">
            D3js patterns have been re-envisioned as typeclasses for scala to provide visual mappings for generic data types.  Using types not only provides "safer" type-checked code, but can also inform important visuals encodings to remove extra boilerplate and provide simpler code.

          </div>
          <div class="abstract">
            Deep learning is predominantly done in Python, a type-unsafe language. Try changing this unfortunate fact by doing it in Scala instead! With expressive types, compile-time typechecking, and awesome DSLs, we present Nexus, a typesafe, expressive and succinct deep learning framework.

            Compiler plugins — mysterious, difficult? Yet intriguing? Dark magic you're frightened, yet tempted, to wield? I'll cover what plugins can do, what existing plugins are popular, and how to write your own, based on one of several simple seed projects I'll present.

            Purely functional code is easier to reason about ... is the functional programmer's guiding mantra. But to what extent is it really easier to reason about? This short talk will look at and challenge this claim, and propose a pragmatic attitude towards purity.

            I will discuss a few of the limitations our engineers have found with Scala’s built-in immutable Map collection to represent key-value pairs. I will present a simple immutable collection (PMaps) that we built to overcome some of the problems we found and enable powerful, principled, and clean code.

            I'll talk about easy, approachable rules of thumb to leverage Scala's type system to improve correctness which can be used in almost any codebase, without enough implicits to make your head (and compiler) explode.

          <div class="abstract">
            There are lots of threats out there, and just as many methods to combat them -- near to every developer's heart is application security, part of any layered defense against the bad guys, a field that has only recently gained traction in the Scala community. Come see how to improve your program!
